The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there are some uncommon errors that can occur when using `calc()`. For example, using different units together without proper conversion can lead to unexpected results.  Another error might involve incorrect operator precedence, where the calculation doesn't follow the intended order of operations.  Finally, forgetting to include spaces around operators is a common mistake that can lead to parsing issues. For instance, `width:calc(100%-5px)` will likely fail, while `width: calc(100% - 5px)` is correct.
